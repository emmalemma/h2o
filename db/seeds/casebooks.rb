Gutman\n\nThis term we will explore the copyright treatment of computer software by examining together the litigation to protect the user interface of the spreadsheet program Lotus 1-2-3, the most popular application program of its time.  We will begin with some background on the law, then proceed to consider the litigation Lotus filed against Paperback Software with respect to the first, self-proclaimed 1-2-3 clone and then address in detail the Lotus v. Borland case, which ended in a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court.  In addition to discussing the relevant legal and policy issues, we will focus on the nuts and bolts litigation questions that arose in the course of multiple trials, two arguments in the First Circuit and a closely watched Supreme Court case that failed to produce a decision.  In our final class, we will fast forward to the present to consider the Federal Circuit’s recent decision in Oracle v. Google (for which a certiorari petition is now pending) addressing similar copyright questions, thirty years after the complaint in Lotus v. Paperback was filed. Time permitting we will also look briefly at how patent protection  for computer software has evolved over the same period.\n\nOur class will meet on the following six dates, in Hauser 102 (unless otherwise noted):\n\n    Wednesday, February 4th, 5-7pm.\n    Wednesday, February 25, 5-7pm.\n    FRIDAY, March 6, 3-5pm (during designated HLS make-up class period) (WCC 3018).\n    Wednesday, March 11, 5-7pm.\n    Wednesday, March 25, 5-7pm.\n    Wednesday, April 8, 5-7pm.", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2014-09-17 00:28:39", updated_at: "2017-07-17 09:02:52"},

This course will explore international law applicable during situations of armed conflict, often referred to as international humanitarian law (IHL) or the law of armed conflict (LOAC). After examining foundational doctrines and concepts, we will explore some of the foremost contemporary challenges in IHL, including direct participation of civilians in hostilities; the interplay between international human rights law, international criminal law, and the law of armed conflict; and the relationship between the legal framework governing terrorism and international humanitarian law. We will investigate such questions as how does international law regulate the means and methods of warfare, protection of civilians, and humanitarian access in situations of armed conflict? How does international law classify and regulate different categories of armed conflict, and how does it distinguish armed conflicts from other situations of organized armed violence? And how does the law seek to balance principles of military necessity and humanity?\n\nABOUT THIS PLAYLIST\n\nThis playlist was built by Naz Modirzadeh and Dustin Lewis, with the help of Faculty Assistant Joely Merriman, to correspond to the syllabus of the fall 2014 class on \"International Humanitarian Law/Laws of War\" at Harvard Law School taught by Lecturer on Law Modirzadeh. \n\nThe playlist links to publicly available resources where they are available and to the HLS iSite (internal course site) for non-publicly-available resources. Users outside of the Harvard community can nonetheless see the list of all of the materials provided for the course through this playlist. \n\nThis playlist is subject to change and will likely be updated throughout the fall of 2014.\n\nLOGISTICS\n\nThere are required readings and recommended (indicated as “supplementary”) readings for each day of class. Students are expected to have read all of the required readings by the designated class. There is a required book for this class — The Handbook of International Humanitarian Law, Third Edition, ed. Fleck (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013). HLS students should be able to access an e-version of the Handbook at  http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:hul.ebook:GEN_9780199658800. The legal instruments and documents required for class are freely available online (including through this H2O playlist). We invite critical feedback and comments on this playlist; please send them to nmodirzadeh@law.harvard.edu and dlewis@law.harvard.edu. \n\nOBJECTIVES \n\nThe primary objective of this course is for students to go gain mastery of the doctrine and modes of argumentation of public international law applicable in armed conflict. The assumption underlying this course is that facility with doctrine is required in order to develop informed opinions, policy positions, and critical perspectives on the many contemporary dilemmas related to the law of armed conflict. Additional objectives include: \n\n1.\tTo develop the capacity to distinguish between lex lata and lex ferenda; \n2.\tTo understand the context in which this law is applied and the relevant factors that may affect its enforcement;  \n3.\tTo enhance skills of persuasion and argumentation, with a historical and global perspective on contemporary challenges; \n4.\tTo understand distinctions between fields of public international law relating to armed conflict and the potential significance of those distinctions; and\n5.\tTo increase understandings of public international law and lawyering more broadly.  \n\nTo help meet these objectives, the course is divided into two sections. The first two-thirds (or so) of the course track the classical components of international law applicable in armed conflict. The last third will allow us to use that set of knowledge, theories, substance, and modes of argumentation and apply them to a number of contemporary dilemmas.", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2014-07-22 16:41:21", updated_at: "2017-07-17 09:02:01"},

Jackson (hjackson@law.harvard.edu),Griswold 510Assistant: Lauren Semrau (lsemrau@law.harvard.edu),Griswold 5 SouthIntroduction         The goal of this course is to introduce students to the law and practice of budgeting in the United States. We will start with an exploration of the basic structure of the federal budget process, including the President's budget and congressional budgeting procedures that are supposed to govern federal spending. We will then examine in greater detail the roles of all three branches of federal government in setting budget policy in the United States, discussing government shut-downs, debt ceiling crises, and ongoing debates over budget reforms and fiscal challenges. The course will also take up the budgeting of entitlements, federal credit programs, and infrastructure spending.  Depending on student interest, we also spend class time on military spending and federal-state relations in budget policy.     The class will meet for twelve sessions, starting on Tuesday, January 3rd, and continuing through Thursday, January 19th. Class will run from 9:30 am until roughly 11:45 am, allowing for two hours of class time and (typically) a short break.  There will be no class on MLK Day, Monday, January 16th.  On two days, we will have luncheon speakers:  Former CBO director and current HKS Dean Douglas Elmendorf will give a luncheon talk on Friday, January 6th, and James Musser, who has for many years been a senior congressional aide working on budget issues and most recently senior adviser to Representative Tom Price, Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget, will give a luncheon talk on Thursday, January 12th.    Luncheon talks will run from noon to 1:00 pm and box lunches will be provided.     Students interested in doing research on budget policy can sign up to write research papers in the Spring Term extension of the course. Research paper topics should be arranged with permission of the instructor and can address a wide range of issues related to budget policy, focusing on issues of current interest, including proposals for reforming budget policy. A list of illustrative research topics appears below.     Readings for the course will consist of a combination of distributed materials, postings on the course's Canvas website, via the H2O link (https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/playlists/51703), and readings from Fiscal Challenges: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Budget Policy (2008) (Elizabeth Garrett, et al. eds.).  For additional background, Allen Schick: The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy and Process (3rd ed. 2007) is a useful reference. Both books should be available at the Harvard Coop. Copies will also be on reserve for the course in Langdell Library. From time to time, students will also be asked to review selections from the Harvard Law School Briefing Papers on Federal Budget Policy (avail. at http://scholar.harvard.edu/briefingpapers). These briefing papers are primarily the work of Harvard students enrolled in earlier versions of this course, and are illustrative of the kinds of research papers students might undertake in the Spring Term.     A final source of background materials for the course are two interactive documents:  2015 Federal Budget Calendar” and 2016 Federal Budget Calendar.  Both documents are posted on H20 and they include extensive links to press accounts and official publications related to budget matters over the past two years. ", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2016-12-15 10:43:58", updated_at: "2017-07-17 09:01:18"},

It is intended to be used as the main casebook for an introductory course on the law of corporations.  This casebook can be printed via CreateSpace and used in a hard copy form, or students can read and access the cases and materials online via the H20 platform at h2o.law.harvard.edu.While the materials in this casebook start with the Delaware corporate code, we will start the class with an online course covering the basic concepts of Agency as well as an online course covering the basic concepts of Partnership. Case materials and resources for Agency and Partnership are embedded in the online courses. Students should plan to complete both of these courses, including the accompanying quizzes in Canvas, by the dates set forth in the syllabus. As you are working on the online courses, in class we will focus on the corporate form and the Delaware corporate code. While the various conceptual approaches to the corporate law are extremely interesting and important, it is critical that law students master the corporate code. Much of the work of the corporate lawyer starts with the code. As such, we will start with an in depth examination of the corporate code.  Although we could study the Model Code or the Massachusetts code, for most corporate lawyers, the Delaware corporate law will be central to their practice. Sixty percent of all publicly traded corporations are Delaware corporations. With respect to private corporations, they are typically incorporated in the state in which they are physically located, or they are incorporated in Delaware. Consequently, the Delaware corporate law is the closest to a lingua franca for US corporate law. Beyond the code, Delaware has a very deep corporate common law. It is in the corporate common law that the courts have developed the law of corporate fiduciary duties. It is through fiduciary duties that the corporate law attempts to regulate the relationship between stockholders and the corporation, between managers and the corporation, as well as the relationships of controlling stockholders and minority stockholders. Delaware's treatment of the corporate common law is so extensive that it is not uncommon at all for the courts of other states to refer to or cite Delaware corporate law cases when deciding questions involving their own corporate law. The fiduciary duties of corporate directors are tested most often in the context of corporate takeovers. The corporate takeover materials in this casebook attempt to highlight the most important issues in takeover situations as well as the court's doctrinal efforts to mitigate the transaction costs that arise in these situations.", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2013-11-15 11:08:22", updated_at: "2017-07-17 09:00:57"},

Jackson (hjackson@law.harvard.edu),Griswold 510Assistant: Carole Mason (camason@law.harvard.edu),Griswold 5 SouthIntroduction                      The goal of this course is to introduce students to the law and practice of budgeting in the United States. At the beginning of the semester, students will be introduced to the basic structure of the federal budget process, including the President's Budget and congressional budgeting procedures that are supposed to govern federal spending. We will explore the roles of all three branches of federal government in setting budget policy in the United States, discussing government shut-downs, debt ceiling crises, and ongoing debates over budget reforms and fiscal challenges. We will then examine the budgeting of entitlements and infrastructure spending, plus state budgeting practices as well as federal-state relations in budget policy. One class will focus on military spending.Students interested in writing a research paper on budget policy can sign up for an additional credit in the Spring term. For these students, the course will continue for four to six two-hour sessions. In addition to covering additional topics, these sessions will include several meetings at which students will present and receive comments on drafts of their research papers. Research paper topics will be arranged with permission of the instructor and can address a wide range of issues related to budget policy, focusing on issues of current interest, including proposals for reforming budget policy. Students interested in writing more extensive papers on related topics for additional credit are welcome to do so.     Readings for the course will consist of a combination of distributed materials, postings on the course's Canvas website, via the H2O link, and readings from Fiscal Challenges: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Budget Policy (2008) (Elizabeth Garrett, et al. eds.), and Allen Schick: The Federal Budget: Politics, Policy and Process (3rd ed. 2007). Both books are recommended for the course and should be available at the Harvard Coop. Copies should also be on reserve for the course in Langdell Library. From time to time, students will also be asked to review selections from the Harvard Law School Briefing Papers on Federal Budget Policy (avail. at http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hjackson/budget.php). These briefing papers are primarily the work of HLS students enrolled in earlier versions of this course, and are illustrative of the kinds of research papers that students participating in the Spring term extension of the course will be expected to produce.An interactive document titled 2015 Federal Budget Calendar is posted to H20 and offers extensive links to press accounts about budget matters in the past year. ", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2016-01-27 15:40:26", updated_at: "2017-07-17 09:00:30"},

Fears about these technological changes come from both traditionally right-wing and traditionally left-wing circles over both government and private sector collection and use of data. There are also intensely positive hopes for the rise of “big data” tied to the ubiquitous presence of recording that may allow for significant improvement in long-standing problems of government, technology, economics, and finance. The fact that some predicted changes from the earlier years of science fiction have now been realized makes it an opportune time to take stock of the state of privacy rights today.Drawing on the instructor’s experience as the Chief Privacy Officer of Facebook from 2005 to 2009 and as an active investor in the technology sector, this class will examine first principles about privacy while maintaining an aggressively empirical focus on the actual state of play in both the surveillance and data analytics worlds.", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2015-03-27 05:27:44", updated_at: "2017-07-17 08:59:16"},

  {id: 4376, title: "Corporations [Playlist #1923]", slug: nil, subtitle: nil, headnote: "This playlist is a virtual casebook for the Corporations course. I designed it as a substitute for the traditional hardbound casebook.[Note: I use additional transactional materials in my class (see here for an example). If you are a student in my class, you will receive them as indicated in the syllabus. If you are an instructor who is considering adopting this casebook, please contact me for the additional materials.]Compared to standard casebooks, I use fewer cases, but I edit them sparingly and sometimes not at all. One reason for this is that the number of seminal cases in corporate law is small. I believe you are better served by knowing the important cases well, rather than by skimming a lot of less important cases. Additionally, much of corporate law consists of broad standards that take on real meaning only in their application. That is why understanding the law often requires reading the full facts of the opinion. The judges clearly considered these factual details important, even on appeal, and so should you! The other reason for focusing on fewer cases is that I want to give you the time necessary to understand the underlying business scenarios, and to reflect on the interactions of the rules discussed in the cases. In corporate law, this is not easy. The structures and transactions are often complex. Please try to understand them as best you can.I have organized the materials largely around the doctrine and particular corporate events. But any one case involves multiple issues, including the underlying business issues. You will learn better if you try to understand the full case, rather than zooming in narrowly on the headline doctrine.With one exception, all of the cases in these materials are either Delaware or federal cases. Delaware law is the dominant corporate law of the United States. In the U.S., each state has its own corporate law, and the applicable law is the law of the state of incorporation. Corporations are free to incorporate where they want, in return for paying incorporation tax (“franchise tax”) in that jurisdiction. Delaware has attracted more than half of all public corporations and many private corporations in the U.S. (Delaware derives a third of its state revenue from the franchise tax!) Furthermore, Delaware is also the model followed by many other states. As a result, I see no point in teaching you other states’ law. I occasionally use other countries’ laws to expose you to alternative arrangements; the variance between countries is much larger than between US states.For similar reasons, I teach only corporations proper. I do not cover partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), or the many other entity forms now available. These other forms are undoubtedly important in practice. But an introductory course cannot teach the nuanced differences between these forms, many of which lie in tax law. So I only give you a brief warning about involuntary partnership in the first class. However, the commonalities between the various entity forms are great.  So if you understand corporate law and the underlying business problems, I trust you will easily learn the other forms when the need arises.GlossaryBylaws = a corporation’s secondary governing document (cf. DGCL 109). Unlike the charter, the bylaws can be amended by the board without shareholder consent.Certificate of Incorporation = a corporation’s founding and primary governing document (cf. DGCL 102).Charter = certificate of incorporation.Common stock / share: see share.Debt holders = creditors.DGCL = Delaware General Corporation Law, i.e., the basic Delaware statute. As a guide to this important statute, I have created the simplified DGCL.Equity; equity capital = the excess of assets over liabilities, if any (or equivalently, non-debt financing).Equity holders = shareholders. The term derives from the fact that roughly speaking, equity is available for distribution to shareholders.Limited liability = no liability (of shareholders). The expression “limited” comes from the observation that shareholders stand to lose whatever they put into the corporation, as this is available to satisfy the corporations' creditors' claims. However, shareholders have no liability beyond that, absent pathological circumstances.Merger = the fusion of two corporations into one (cf. DGCL 251).Preferred stock / share = stock with special rights (“preferences”), generally with respect to dividends. A standard term is that preferred shares are entitled to a certain dividend per year, payable if and when a dividend will be paid to common stockholders. In return, preferred shares often do not carry voting rights.Public corporation = a corporation whose stock is publicly traded, usually on a regulated stock exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange.Share = an interest in the corporation with rights that are defined by the corporation’s charter. Unlike debt, shares do not provide a right to fixed payouts. Rather, the board decides if and when shareholders will receive so-called dividends. The default rule is that each share provides one vote (cf. DGCL 212) and equal dividend rights; such shares are called “common shares” or “common stock.”Stock = a synonym or collective term for shares (as in “twenty shares of the corporation’s stock”).", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2013-08-15 15:33:37", updated_at: "2017-07-17 08:59:13"},

For the former, students will have an opportunity to hone rhetorical skills in a chosen format -- speaking, presenting, moderating or production of media -- and for the latter, we will explore the evolving nature of discourse in the networked public sphere, from \"electronic town halls\" to Wikipedia to anonymous and identified commenting. Some of our questions: What roles do and should intermediaries play in setting our topical agendas and shaping conversations around them? What impact does and can money have in influencing opinion on a large scale? What new modalities exist to facilitate conversation and closure among parties who disagree in good faith? Should advocates and agents be treated the same as those who claim to be speaking for themselves? Are there ways to identify and mitigate discourse grounded in bad faith, a.k.a. truthiness?\n\nAssignments\n\nThe major assignments for the course will entail 5-minute talks and an 800-1200-word short-form pieces both on topics of the student’s choosing.  The assignments will be somewhat customizable in that students may choose whether to write two short-form articles and give one talk or give two talks and write one article.  Students that give two talks will receive feedback between their first and second talks, and students that write short-form pieces will receive comments between the two. The assignment schedule will be determined once we know how many students will be focusing on short-form writing and how many will be focusing on public speaking.  The idea for both the talks and the short-form pieces is for students to try their hands at some of the rhetorical and discursive concepts and strategies discussed in class.  Thus, while students can select the content for their talks and articles, both should be crafted with an eye towards using the tools and techniques of the course.  Students may also request to substitute a similarly substantive contribution to public discourse of another form (e.g. a video) for either the talks or the short-form articles.\n\nIn addition to the major assignments, there will occasionally be weekly assignments that require students to do some research or participate in an asynchronous exercise.  These will both be communicated through email and through the H2O syllabus.\n\nGrading\n\nThe grading for this course will be as follows: 60% for talks and short-form writing (20% for each assignment) and 40% for class participation, mailing-list participation, and weekly assignments.

The semester will begin with an overview of the history of budget for the federal government and an introduction to the components of the current federal budget.  We will then examine in some detail congressional budget procedures, where the most elaborate and prominent system of budgetary procedures have been developed, albeit a system of rules that is honored as often in breach as in observance.  We will next take up the Executive power of the purse in a variety of contexts, including government shutdowns and debt ceiling crisis, as well as Judicial power of the purse, including its interaction with the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.  Having worked through the budgeting powers of the three branches of the federal government, we will next take up entitlement reform, accounting standards for government bodies, selected topics associated with budgeting in a federal system, and finally state budget practices.   In addition to its substantive coverage, the course is designed to introduce students to principal sources of information on federal budgeting and leading academic perspectives on budget policy.  Students will also be expected to do their own original research on current issues in federal budget policy. \n\nDuring the first eight weeks of the semester, the course will meet for fourteen 90 minutes sessions during which we will work through the substantive topics outlined above.   For the final four weeks of the semester, the course will meet for eight 120 minutes sessions during which students will present preliminary drafts of their research papers.   A list of potential research topics are listed at the back of this syllabus.   Students will be asked to choose amongst these research topics or suggest their own topics subject to Professor Jackson’s approval.  In most cases, students will be encouraged to work on their research papers in pairs, although again individual assignments are possible with permission of the instructor.    Course grades will be based on research papers and class participation.  There will be no examination for the course.\n\n\tReadings for the course will consist of a combination of distributed materials, postings on the course iSite, and readings from FISCAL CHALLENGES: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO BUDGET POLICY (2008) (Elizabeth Garrett, et al. eds.), and ALLEN SCHICK: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: POLITICS, POLICY AND PROCESS (3rd ed. 2007).  Both books are recommended for the course and should be available at the Harvard Coop.  Copies should also be on reserve for the course in Langdell Library.  Additional readings are available via the H2O distribution system, which is linked to the course iSite under Course materials.

We will examine – and work through -- a wind farm project from a variety of perspectives and meet with people who represent some of these interests: regulatory, community, NGO and private sector. The emphasis will not be on mastering the substance of the various environmental laws that are triggered (although some of that will be necessary), but instead on the practical skills and knowledge necessary to: identify the environmental impacts of a project; identify, parse and apply relevant statutes and regulations; analyze mechanisms for mitigating project impacts and managing controversies; identify the permits and approvals needed for a project; select and hire environmental scientists and experts to support or oppose a project; and, defend (or challenge) a project in administrative and judicial proceedings. Students in this class will learn how projects proceed through environmental review, challenges, and permitting. Depending on the time available and level of class interest, we will also look at some of the project financing issues.\nThe course is practical, hands-on and participatory. Students will develop and apply the skills and methods needed to site a wind farm through class discussions, problem solving, and role-playing exercises. The wind farm is a proxy for any project that has both positive and adverse environmental impacts and that must work its way through multiple types of administrative and judicial proceedings and negotiation. There is no final exam. There will be short written and oral exercises through the semester and, at the end of the semester, a short final paper that focuses on ethical issues raised by the practice of environmental law. Grading will be based on the quality of class participation as well as of the exercises and final paper.\n", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2014-12-02 19:42:53", updated_at: "2017-07-17 08:58:32"},

In the Fall of 2014, coverage will emphasize many aspects of the implementation of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.  Margaret E.

The semester will begin with an overview of the history of budget for the federal government and an introduction to the components of the current federal budget.  We will then examine in some detail congressional budget procedures, where the most elaborate and prominent system of budgetary procedures have been developed, albeit a system of rules that is honored as often in breach as in observance.  We will next take up the Executive power of the purse in a variety of contexts, including government shutdowns and debt ceiling crisis, as well as Judicial power of the purse, including its interaction with the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.  Having worked through the budgeting powers of the three branches of the federal government, we will next take up entitlement reform, accounting standards for government bodies, selected topics associated with budgeting in a federal system, and finally state budget practices.   In addition to its substantive coverage, the course is designed to introduce students to principal sources of information on federal budgeting and leading academic perspectives on budget policy.  Students will also be expected to do their own original research on current issues in federal budget policy. \n\nDuring the first eight weeks of the semester, the course will meet for fourteen 90 minutes sessions during which we will work through the substantive topics outlined above.   For the final four weeks of the semester, the course will meet for eight 120 minutes sessions during which students will present preliminary drafts of their research papers.   A list of potential research topics are listed at the back of this syllabus.   Students will be asked to choose amongst these research topics or suggest their own topics subject to Professor Jackson’s approval.  In most cases, students will be encouraged to work on their research papers in pairs, although again individual assignments are possible with permission of the instructor.    Course grades will be based on research papers and class participation.  There will be no examination for the course.\n\n\tReadings for the course will consist of a combination of distributed materials, postings on the course iSite, and readings from FISCAL CHALLENGES: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO BUDGET POLICY (2008) (Elizabeth Garrett, et al. eds.), and ALLEN SCHICK: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: POLITICS, POLICY AND PROCESS (3rd ed. 2007).  Both books are recommended for the course and should be available at the Harvard Coop.  Copies should also be on reserve for the course in Langdell Library.  Additional readings are available via the H2O distribution system, which is linked to the course iSite under Course materials.  From time to time, students will also be asked to review selections from the Harvard Law School Briefing Papers on Federal Budget Policy (avail. at http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hjackson/budget.php).  These briefing papers are primarily the work of HLS students enrolled in earlier version of this course, and are illustrative of the kinds of research papers that students in this year’s course will be expected to produce.\n\n", public: true, casebook_id: nil, ordinals: [], copy_of_id: nil, is_alias: nil, resource_type: nil, resource_id: nil, created_at: "2014-01-21 17:54:43", updated_at: "2017-07-17 08:58:05"},
